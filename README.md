# Fridge Tracker - Sinatra

This application lets users create personalized lists to track the items in their refrigerator on any given day. Users are able to freely add, edit and delete their own inventories as long as they are logged into their accounts. This is a closed application and therefore users will not have access to view or edit the inventories of other users.

## Installation

1. Fork and clone the repository
2. Run `bundle install` to require all gem dependencies
3. Run `shotgun` to locally host the application on your server
4. In your web browser, visit http://localhost:9393/ (the default port for shotgun)
